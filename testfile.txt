GitHub is a website for storing git repositories (repos). These are programming source files, and other assets. Git has very powerful history tracking of your projects including the ability to revert changes. GitHub is a remote website for storing source files that are under git version control. Having git repos on a remote web site allows others to access, view, clone (download), alter and collaborate. It also means if your computer is stollen, damaged, or something else terrible happens your project files will not be lost!
